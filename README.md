I would like to create a forklift operating simulation using virtual controls in VR.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Organisation (OSHA), as of 2013 there are about 85 deaths per year in forklift related accidents.
The OSHA estimates around 70% of these could be avoided with proper safety training and procedures.
While it is an incredibly small percentage of people working in this industry it is still unacceptable that there are this many avoidable, fatal accidents. 
To operate a forklift, you need to have completed a training course which includes a theory and practical part.
The theoretical section is on a number of subjects including operating practices, daily inspections and hydraulic systems.
You also need practical training in manoeuvrability, handling pallets and forklift controls. 
While it wonâ€™t be a total replacement for the current system, I feel this virtual reality (VR) operating simulator could help reduce this.
