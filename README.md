## Final Year Project for Computer Science 2018/19

Author: Simon O'Leary

Supervisor: DR. Bryan Duggan 

This project aims to create a virtual reality simulation in which the user can practice operating a forklift. 
An estimated 70% of forklift-related accidents could be avoided with proper training. 
The purpose of this simulation is to help workers gain more experience which will reduce the number of accidents of this kind. 
Virtual reality is being used as a training tool in a number of areas and this seems like another good application of the technology. 
This simulation is implemented using C# and Unity, and uses the SteamVR software development kit, 
meaning it is compatible with both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. 
The project uses virtual controls and incorporates AI to give the user a greater sense of immersion.
